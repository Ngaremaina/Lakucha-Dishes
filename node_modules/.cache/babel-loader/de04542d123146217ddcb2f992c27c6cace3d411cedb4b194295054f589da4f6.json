Shared access is\n * currently optional and not enabled unless all clients invoke\n * `enablePersistence()` with `{synchronizeTabs:true}`.\n *\n * In multi-tab mode, if multiple clients are active at the same time, the SDK\n * will designate one client as the “primary client”. An effort is made to pick\n * a visible, network-connected and active client, and this client is\n * responsible for letting other clients know about its presence.

The effects of these operations are written to persistence\n * and then broadcast to other tabs via LocalStorage (see\n * `WebStorageSharedClientState`), which then refresh their state from\n * persistence.\n *\n * Similarly, the primary client listens to notifications sent by secondary\n * clients to discover persistence changes written by secondary clients, such as\n * the addition of new mutations and query targets.\n *\n * If multi-tab is not enabled and another tab already obtained the primary\n * lease, IndexedDbPersistence enters a failed state and all subsequent\n * operations will automatically fail.\n *\n * Additionally, there is an optimization so that when a tab is closed, the\n * primary lease is released immediately (this is especially important to make\n * sure that a refreshed tab is able to immediately re-acquire the primary\n * lease).

Otherwise, if the transaction failed, a\n * rejected promise with the corresponding failure error is returned.\n */\n/**\n * @license\n * Copyright 2017 Google LLC\n *\n * Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n * you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n * You may obtain a copy of the License at\n *\n *   http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n *\n * Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n * distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n * WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n * See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n * limitations under the License.\n */\n/** Helper function to assert Uint8Array is available at runtime. */\nfunction Ic() {\n  if (\"undefined\" == typeof Uint8Array) throw new D(N.UNIMPLEMENTED, \"Uint8Arrays are not available in this environment.\");\n}\n\n/** Helper function to assert Base64 functions are available at runtime. */\nfunction Tc() {\n  if (\"undefined\" == typeof atob) throw new D(N.UNIMPLEMENTED, \"Blobs are unavailable in Firestore in this environment.\");\n}\n\n/** Immutable class holding a blob (binary data) */\nvar _c = /** @class */function () {\n    function t(t) {\n      this._delegate = t;\n    }\n    return t.fromBase64String = function (e) {\n      return Tc(), new t(da.fromBase64String(e));\n    }, t.fromUint8Array = function (e) {\n      return Ic(), new t(da.fromUint8Array(e));\n    }, t.prototype.toBase64 = function () {\n      return Tc(), this._delegate.toBase64();\n    }, t.prototype.toUint8Array = function () {\n      return Ic(), this._delegate.toUint8Array();\n    }, t.prototype.isEqual = function (t) {\n      return this._delegate.isEqual(t._delegate);\n    }, t.prototype.toString = function () {\n      return \"Blob(base64: \" + this.toBase64() + \")\";\n    }, t;\n  }(),\n  Ec = /** @class */function () {\n    function t() {}\n    return t.prototype.enableIndexedDbPersistence = function (t, e) {\n      return function (t, e) {\n        fa(t = zu(t, ua));\n        var n = aa(t),\n          r = t._freezeSettings(),\n          i = new du();\n        return ha(n, i, new fu(i, r.cacheSizeBytes, null == e ? void 0 : e.forceOwnership));\n      }(t._delegate, {\n        forceOwnership: e\n      });\n    }, t.prototype.enableMultiTabIndexedDbPersistence = function (t) {\n      return function (t) {\n        fa(t = zu(t, ua));\n        var e = aa(t),\n          n = t._freezeSettings(),\n          r = new du();\n        return ha(e, r, new lu(r, n.cacheSizeBytes));\n      }(t._delegate);\n    }, t.prototype.clearIndexedDbPersistence = function (t) {\n      return function (t) {\n        var e = this;\n        if (t._initialized && !t._terminated) throw new D(N.FAILED_PRECONDITION, \"Persistence can only be cleared before a Firestore instance is initialized or after it is terminated.\");\n        var i = new br();\n        return t._queue.enqueueAndForgetEvenWhileRestricted(function () {\n          return n(e, void 0, void 0, function () {\n            var e;\n            return r(this, function (o) {\n              switch (o.label) {\n                case 0:\n                  return o.trys.push([0, 2,, 3]), [4 /*yield*/, function (t) {\n                    return n(this, void 0, void 0, function () {\n                      var e;\n                      return r(this, function (n) {\n                        switch (n.label) {\n                          case 0:\n                            return _r.yt() ?

Data is stored persistently\n * across sessions.\n *\n * On Web only, the Firestore SDKs support shared access to its persistence\n * layer. This allows multiple browser tabs to read and write to IndexedDb and\n * to synchronize state even without network connectivity. Shared access is\n * currently optional and not enabled unless all clients invoke\n * `enablePersistence()` with `{synchronizeTabs:true}`.\n *\n * In multi-tab mode, if multiple clients are active at the same time, the SDK\n * will designate one client as the “primary client”. An effort is made to pick\n * a visible, network-connected and active client, and this client is\n * responsible for letting other clients know about its presence. The primary\n * client writes a unique client-generated identifier (the client ID) to\n * IndexedDb’s “owner” store every 4 seconds. If the primary client fails to\n * update this entry, another client can acquire the lease and take over as\n * primary.\n *\n * Some persistence operations in the SDK are designated as primary-client only\n * operations. This includes the acknowledgment of mutations and all updates of\n * remote documents. The effects of these operations are written to persistence\n * and then broadcast to other tabs via LocalStorage (see\n * `WebStorageSharedClientState`), which then refresh their state from\n * persistence.\n *\n * Similarly, the primary client listens to notifications sent by secondary\n * clients to discover persistence changes written by secondary clients, such as\n * the addition of new mutations and query targets.\n *\n * If multi-tab is not enabled and another tab already obtained the primary\n * lease, IndexedDbPersistence enters a failed state and all subsequent\n * operations will automatically fail.\n *\n * Additionally, there is an optimization so that when a tab is closed, the\n * primary lease is released immediately (this is especially important to make\n * sure that a refreshed tab is able to immediately re-acquire the primary\n * lease). Unfortunately, IndexedDB cannot be reliably used in window.unload\n * since it is an asynchronous API. So in addition to attempting to give up the\n * lease, the leaseholder writes its client ID to a \"zombiedClient\" entry in\n * LocalStorage which acts as an indicator that another tab should go ahead and\n * take the primary lease immediately regardless of the current lease timestamp.\n *\n * TODO(b/114226234): Remove `synchronizeTabs` section when multi-tab is no\n * longer optional.\n */\nclass ki {\n    constructor(\n    /**\n     * Whether to synchronize the in-memory state of multiple tabs and share\n     * access to local persistence.\n     */\n    t, e, n, s, i, r, o, c, u, \n    /**\n     * If set to true, forcefully obtains database access.
